	<h1>European Call Options</h1>
	<h4> Definition from Investopedia</h4>
	<p>A European call option gives the owner the right to acquire the underlying security at expiry. For an investor to profit from a call option, the stock's price, at expiry, has to be trading high enough above the strike price to cover the cost of the option premium. </p>

<p>
From the book, <b> Definition 7.2 </b> we say <i> The time value of an option is the difference between the price of the option and its intrinsic value: </i> 
\(C^E ( t ) - ( S ( t ) - X )^+\) for a European Call
</p>

<p>This comes up in Autumn 2020 Question 1 (d) </p>
