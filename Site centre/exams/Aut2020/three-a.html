    The price evolution of an asset is modeled by a 4-period binomial tree.
The initial price of the asset is €100, and in each period the price of the asset may
increase by 5% or decrease by 5%.
In each period, €1 invested in the risk-free bond will increase to €1.02 at the end of the
period.
    </i>

<p><b> What are the possible final prices of the asset, and with what risk-neutral probabilities do these prices occur?</b></p>

  <p> How dow we calculate this?</p>
